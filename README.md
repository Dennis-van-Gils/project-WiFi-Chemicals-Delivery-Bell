# WiFi Chemicals Delivery Bell

This project concerns an automated delivery notification system for when chemicals get delivered in our laboratory. Simply put, it is a box containing two huge arcade buttons which should get pressed by the deliverer: One for regular chemicals, and the other for temperature-critical (cooled) chemicals. Once pushed, the buttons will light up and an email will be send to a configurable mailing list to inform everyone that chemicals are awaiting. There is also a web-interface that shows the current status, which you could check on your smart-phone, for instance. The buttons can be reset by pressing them again. This will revert to status to 'No chemicals awaiting' once more.
